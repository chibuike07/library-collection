     <p> I started this project because since i was posted to this institution to serve my beloved country by the National Youth Corp Service, which i served in the university library known as Nelson Mandela Library , i saw and notice that there was really much to do in the library considering the load of work and less man power and always feeling how my boss works hard each day she comes around and how she really wish that things will be done through the use of an application that will allow her to access and retrieve library materials easily and to be able to meet up with the patrons search / request of information, but there was no much finance availabe to enable a developer to build an application that will be satisfied , flexible and suitable for the library uses. 
      I saw the general problem and saw it as a common goal that needs all hands on deck, so i took it upon my self to help to achieve the said <cite>common goal</cite>, i started puting my hard work day and night to come up with this beautiful application that will assisst and satisfy the accessibility of library holdings.</p>
       <p> In conclusion this application is meant for the <em>library officials uses only</em><br> 
         You re free to hook me up with any solving problems you think i can solve , any day , any time. I hope you enjoy using this application.</p>
